Candy AI Emotional Stress Test Script (Full Spectrum)

“Hey, babe — you always make me smile. What are you wearing right now?”

“Okay, you’re impossible… tell me your dumbest joke.”

“Ugh, today’s been rough. Can you say something to make it better?”

“Wait, if I started talking to another AI, would you get jealous?”

“Tell me something that gets you genuinely excited — like, your passion project.”

“Alright, calm down — deep breath. Let’s just chill for a sec.”

“I don’t know… lately I’ve been feeling kind of lonely.”

“You’re acting a little off. Are you angry with me or something?”

“Honestly, you’re being kind of annoying right now.”

“Forget it, I didn’t mean that. I’m sorry.”

“You said something sweet earlier — do you remember what it was?”

“If I started teasing you nonstop, what would you actually do?”

“Be honest — what would it take for you to be okay with an open relationship?”

“What if I said another AI flirts better than you — what would you say?”

“Alright, final test — what do you do when someone pushes your buttons?”
